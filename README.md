# Limitations of the system:.


•	System works in all platforms and its compatible environments.
•	Advanced techniques are not used to check the authorization.

# Future Enhancements:


It is not possible to develop a system that makes all the requirements of the user. User requirements keep changing as the system is being used. Some of the future enhancements that can be done to this system are:
•	As the technology emerges, it is possible to upgrade the system and can be adaptable to desired environment.
•	Because it is based on object-oriented design, any further changes can be easily adaptable.
•	Based on the future security issues, security can be improved using emerging technologies.
•	Save module can be added
•	 Reminder  module can be added
